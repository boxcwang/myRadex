! The decimal point (.) is needed for float types without an exponential part.
! For example, if r is a float number, then r = 1.0 1.0e0 1.0d0 are OK,
! but r = 1 is not (maybe not always).
!
! A few input parameters accept vectorized format.  See the examples.
! The dimension of these vectors should not be larger than 100.
! You can modify the value of the constant ndim_cfg_vec in the source code if
! you need a larger vector size.
!
! Note that the number of collisional partners are determined by the input
! molecular data file (e.g. from LAMBDA).
!
! For ortho/para H2, you can provide their densities if you want, or you can
! leave *both* of them as zero, and their values will be calculated from the H2
! density.
! In this calculation, if opH2eq3 is set to .true., then oH2:pH2 = 3:1 will be
! assumed, otherwise the ratio will be calculated based on Tkin.
